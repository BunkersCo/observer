OpenBroadcaster - Server Installation Instructions

More info at https://wiki.openbroadcaster.com

These instructions are an alternative to using ob.installer.sh.

*** Enable setting "short_open_tag = On" in your php.ini ***

*** After install, log in as user with Admin privileges and then run https://YOUR_IP/updates ***

Note: When using special characters in the password, they need to use single quotes instead of double quotes when they echo the string 

1. See dependencies.txt for server dependencies.  Mostly PHP/MySQL related, but 
   a few things to support transcoding and media identification. 

2. Copy server files to a web environment (web document root).

3. Import db/dbclean.sql to a database.

4. Copy config.sample.php to config.php, and edit as necessary.

5. Ensure media storage directories are writable by the web server.

6. In the web document root, create 'assets', 'assets/profile_img', and
   'assets/uploads' directories.  These directories should be writable by the
   web server.

7. The database import includes one user.  The username is admin.  The password
   is something you must set in the database as follows (PHP):

   mysql_query('UPDATE users set password = "'.password_hash($new_password.OB_HASH_SALT, PASSWORD_DEFAULT).'"
                where username = "admin"');

8. Log into OpenBroadcaster as admin, and access http://ob_install_url/updates/ to
   verify your installation and run any required updates.

Password Login

(installer might not create properly)

First need the value of OB_HASH_SALT from the config file.

Append that value to the password you wants. If the salt is aaaaaaaaaa and the password is password, the string he needs is aaaaaaaaaapassword

from there, get the sha value like this:

echo -n "aaaaaaaaaapassword" | openssl sha1 | cut -f 2 -d " "

copy the string that this puts out.

the log into mysql:

mysql -u root -p

select database:

use openbroadcaster

UPDATE users SET password='d8656d3f3823bce79e3a29253cf1106f6cfeee7c' WHERE username='admin';

Now, assuming that the salt is set as aaaaaaaaaa in the config file, the password password will work.
